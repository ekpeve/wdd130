        <p class="review-paragraph">Candy: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Ever since one of my friends recommended Becky to me I am always super happy with my hair! I have softer hair for my hair type and Becky has taken the time to acknowledge that and give me suggestions with the styles I want to make sure I’m not damaging my hair. I would recommend Becky to anyone who is looking for a stylist that cares about your natural hair and your protective style. 🫶🏾

        <p class="review-paragraph">Tolu: In a small space like Rexburg, it’s hard to find someone who can take great care of my hair until I found Becky. I started my natural journey about 4 years ago and I’m still trying to learn about ways to take care of my hair. It’s been easier having Becky who gives me tips on what to do with my hair. She also preps my hair very well before braiding it. She’s concerned about taking care of your hair in general and keeping it healthy instead of just getting the hairstyle done.</p>

        <p class="review-paragraph">Brittany: 5/5 ⭐️!! the braids have lasted me longer. I have looked good for the longest amount of time than any other person I’ve gone to. She was super sweet, we weren’t bored the whole time, we had fun while she did my hair and she gave me the full experience of making sure all of the braids looked really nice and not rushed. Definitely gotta be a regular ✨ </p>
