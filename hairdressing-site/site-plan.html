        About Me
      </h2>
      <p>
        My name is Rebecca Adekunle, but most of my friends call me Becky. As a child, I disovered my passion for hairdressing through playing with dolls. I have been styling hair for for 11 years now, starting when I was just 10 years old by braiding my classmates' hair. Over the years, I have broadened my hairdressing skills, and I am still improving on myself to become better each day.
